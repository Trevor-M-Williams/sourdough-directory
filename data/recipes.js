Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 4-6 hours, or until doubled in size.\n6. Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a round or oval loaf.\n7. Place the shaped dough in a proofing basket (or on a baking sheet) and let it rise for another 1-2 hours, covered.\n8. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). If using a Dutch oven, place it in the oven to heat up as well.\n9. Once the dough has risen again, carefully place it onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet or into the hot Dutch oven.\n10. Score the top of the loaf with a sharp knife for better oven spring.\n11. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped on the bottom.\n12. Remove from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing.",

      instructions:
        "1. In a large mixing bowl, combine warm water and sugar. Sprinkle yeast over the top and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it's foamy.\n2. Add in the olive oil, sea salt, oregano, and thyme to the yeast mixture. Stir to combine thoroughly.\n3. Gradually add the flour, mixing until the dough comes together. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.\n4. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow it to rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.\n5. Once risen, preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).\n6. Grease a large baking sheet or a 12x17 inch pan with olive oil.\n7. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and spread it out gently using your fingers. You can make dimples in the dough for a classic focaccia look.\n8. Evenly distribute the olives, cherry tomatoes, and red onion over the top of the dough, pressing them in slightly. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.\n9. Let the dough rise again for about 20-30 minutes, then bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.\n10. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.

Once risen, punch down the dough and divide it into 8 equal pieces.\n5. Shape each piece into a ball and then poke a hole in the middle with your thumb. Carefully stretch the hole to about 2 inches wide to form a bagel shape.\n6. Place the shaped bagels on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and cover them with a damp cloth. Let them rest for another 30-45 minutes.\n7. While the bagels are resting, preheat your oven to 220°C (430°F) and bring a large pot of water to a boil. Stir in the malt syrup.\n8. Once the water is bubbling, carefully drop in 2-3 bagels at a time and boil for 1-2 minutes on each side. Use a slotted spoon to remove them and transfer to a wire rack to drain.\n9. Brush each boiled bagel with an egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder as desired.\n10. Arrange the bagels on a baking sheet and bake them in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown.\n11. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before serving.",
